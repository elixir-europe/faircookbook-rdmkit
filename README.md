# FAIR Cookbook - RDMkit

This repository will in the first place be used to link pages between [FAIR Cookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/) and [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/). These links are made and curated by the joint editorial board that exists between both teams. 

Both websites have their content managed and deployed using GitHub:

- RDMkit: https://github.com/elixir-europe/rdmkit
- FAIR Cookbook: https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook

## Who are we?

To align visions and to keep track of content changes in both repositories we created a joint editorial board between FAIR Cookbook and RDMkit. This board meets every two months.

## The heart of our collaboration

Links between the two services are stored in the [`faircookbook_rdmkit_mapping.yml`](https://github.com/elixir-europe/faircookbook-rdmkit/blob/main/faircookbook_rdmkit_mapping.yml) file. Changes made to this file will not immediately impact the websites. On a weekly basis Fair Cookbook and RDMkit will pull changes from this central yml file to update there repository. This is done using GitHub pages and and is fully automatic. Any links towards FAIR Cookbook/RDMkit that were made manually will be overwritten by this process. In short: this repository holds the truth!

## Code of conduct

Changes made to the [`faircookbook_rdmkit_mapping.yml`](https://github.com/elixir-europe/faircookbook-rdmkit/blob/main/faircookbook_rdmkit_mapping.yml) file will only be merged in the `main` branch using pull requests and when at least one member of both editorials teams have approved the changes.
